# moov-io/fed

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Fed implements utility services for searching the United States Federal Reserve System such as [ABA routing numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_routing_transit_number), financial institution name lookup, and [Fedwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire) and [FedACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedACH) routing information. The HTTP server is available in a [Docker image](#docker) and the Go package `github.com/moov-io/fed` is available. Moov's primary usage for this project is with ACH origination in our [paygate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate) project.

The data and formats in this repository represent a compilation of **FedWire** and **FedACH** data from the [Federal Reserve Bank Services site](https://frbservices.org/). Both the official Fed plaintext and JSON file formats are supported.

### Project status

Moov Fed is actively used in multiple production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. We would appreciate any issues created or pull requests. Thanks!

### Usage

The Fed project implements an HTTP server and [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/fed) for searching for FedACH and Fedwire participants.

**Note**: The data files included in this repository ([`FedACHdir.md`](./docs/FedACHdir.md) and [`fpddir.md`](./docs/fpddir.md)) are **outdated** and from 2018. The Fed no longer releases this data publicly and licensing on more recent files prevents us from distributing them. However, the Fed still complies this data and you can retrieve up-to-date files for use in our project, either from [Accuity](https://accuity.com/product/us-payments-routing-and-transit-number-file/) or your financial institution.

Moov Fed can read the data files from anywhere on the filesystem. This allows you to mount the files and set `FEDACH_DATA_PATH` / `FEDWIRE_DATA_PATH` environmental variables. Both official formats from the Federal Reserve (plaintext and JSON) are supported.

#### Download files

The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) eServices offers API access to download the files. To download these files, work with your ODFI / banking partner to obtain a download code. Then run Fed with the following environment variables set.

```
FRB_ROUTING_NUMBER=123456780
FRB_DOWNLOAD_CODE=86cfa5a9-1ab9-4af5-bd89-0f84d546de13
```

### Docker

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/fed`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/fed/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8086` and metrics at `:9096/metrics` in Prometheus format. We also have Docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/fed?tab=tags) published as `quay.io/moov/fed`.

Pull & start the Docker image:
```
docker pull moov/fed:latest
docker run -p 8086:8086 -p 9096:9096 moov/fed:latest
```

#### **ACH routing number example**

Fed can be used to look up Financial Institutions for Automated Clearing House ([ACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House)) transfers by their routing number (`?routingNumber=...`):

```
curl "localhost:8086/fed/ach/search?routingNumber=273976369"
```
```
{
  "achParticipants": [
    {
      "routingNumber": "273976369",
      "officeCode": "O",
      "servicingFRBNumber": "071000301",
      "recordTypeCode": "1",
      "revised": "041513",
      "newRoutingNumber": "000000000",
      "customerName": "VERIDIAN CREDIT UNION",
      "achLocation": {
        "address": "1827 ANSBOROUGH",
        "city": "WATERLOO",
        "state": "IA",
        "postalCode": "50702",
        "postalCodeExtension": "0000"
      },
      "phoneNumber": "3192878332",
      "statusCode": "1",
      "viewCode": "1"
    }
  ],
  "wireParticipants": null
}
```

#### **Wire routing number example**

Fed can be used to look up Financial Institutions for [Fedwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire) messages by their routing number (`?routingNumber=...`):

```
curl "localhost:8086/fed/wire/search?routingNumber=273976369"
```
```
{
  "achParticipants": null,
  "wireParticipants": [
    {
      "routingNumber": "273976369",
      "telegraphicName": "VERIDIAN",
      "customerName": "VERIDIAN CREDIT UNION",
      "wireLocation": {
        "city": "WATERLOO",
        "state": "IA"
      },
      "fundsTransferStatus": "Y",
      "fundsSettlementOnlyStatus": " ",
      "bookEntrySecuritiesTransferStatus": "N",
      "date": "20141107"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Google Cloud Run

To get started in a hosted environment you can deploy this project to the Google Cloud Platform.

From your [Google Cloud dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) create a new project and call it:
```
moov-fed-demo
```

Enable the [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) API for your project and associate a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) if needed. Then, open the Cloud Shell terminal and run the following Docker commands, substituting your unique project ID:

```
docker pull moov/fed
docker tag moov/fed gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/fed
docker push gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/fed
```

Deploy the container to Cloud Run:
```
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/fed --port 8086
```

Select your target platform to `1`, service name to `fed`, and region to the one closest to you (enable Google API service if a prompt appears). Upon a successful build you will be given a URL where the API has been deployed:

```
https://YOUR-FED-APP-URL.a.run.app
```

Now you can ping the server:
```
curl https://YOUR-FED-APP-URL.a.run.app/ping
```
You should get this response:
```
PONG
```

| `HTTPS_KEY_FILE`  | Filepath of a private key matching the leaf certificate from `HTTPS_CERT_FILE`. | Empty |

### Data persistence
By design, Fed  **does not persist** (save) any data about the search queries created. The only storage occurs in memory of the process and upon restart Fed will have no files or data saved. Also, no in-memory encryption of the data is performed.

### Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go.
