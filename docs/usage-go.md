# Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) and Go v1.18 or newer. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

```
$ git@github.com:moov-io/fed.git

# Pull down into the Go Module cache
$ go get -u github.com/moov-io/fed

$ go doc github.com/moov-io/fed ACHDictionary
```
